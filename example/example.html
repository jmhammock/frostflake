        <!-- SPRITE DEMO -->
        <section class="demo">
            <h1>Sprite Demo</h1>
            <canvas id="spriteDemo"></canvas>
            <p>
                Sprites are the basic type that all game objects derive from. 
                Sprites don't have to have a texture. A sprite may not have a 
                texture of its own but can have textured child sprites that
                render. This allows the developer to create complex objects
                from modular, child objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                This example demonstrates a custom parent sprite with no texture.
                It contains two custom child sprites that are positioned relatively
                to the parent. As the parent rotates, the children are rendered
                relative to the parent rotation.
            </p>

        <!-- ANIMATION DEMO -->
        <section class="demo">
            <h1>Animation Demo</h1>
            <canvas id="animationDemo"></canvas>
            <p>
                Animations exist as a property on a sprite object. An animation
                keeps track of sequences, frames, frame durations and the current
                frame that should render. Animations can be defined in code but
                it is recommended that developers define and load animations from
                JSON.
            </p>
            <p>
                This example demonstrates a spritesheet and a JSON-defined animation.
                Animating sprites behave just like non-animated sprites and can be
                attached to a parent sprite or have child sprites of their own.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that loading JSON performs an AJAX call. Browsers do not allow
                this on pages that are loaded from a file. To load JSON you will need 
                to host this page using a server technology. We recommend Node.js with
                the "http-server" module for quick-easy testing!
